= Ka-Ro Yocto BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
mkdir ~/bin
curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
mkdir karo-bsp
cd karo-bsp
repo init --no-clone-bundle -u https://github.com/karo-electronics/karo-bsp -b rocko
repo sync

At the end of the commands you have all metadata you need to start work with.

=== Building Linux Kernel and rootfs (for U-Boot see below!)

To start a simple Linux kernel and rootfs image build:

[source,console]
MACHINE=imx6q-tx6-nand source ./setup-environment build-imx6q-tx6-nand
bitbake karo-image-minimal

This will create a console oriented rootfs that is mounted read-only and
can be used to check all hardware components of the Ka-Ro modules and
baseboards.

A BSP with X server and GUI can be configured and built using:

[source,console]
MACHINE=imx6q-tx6-emmc DISTRO=karo-x11 source ./setup-environment build-imx6q-tx6-emmc
bitbake karo-image-x11


'MACHINE' in the above examples can be any one of:

[source,console]
imx6q-tx6-nand                  # for TX6Q-1030, TX6Q-1130
imx6q-tx6-emmc                  # for TX6Q-1020, TX6Q-1036
imx6dl-tx6-nand                 # for TX6U-8030/8130, TX6S-8034/8134
imx6dl-tx6-emmc                 # for TX6S-8035/8135
imx6qp-tx6-emmc                 # for TX6Q-8037/8137
imx6ul-txul-nand                # for TXUL-5010
imx6ul-txul-emmc                # for TXUL-5011/5012
imx6ull-txul-emmc               # for TXUL-8013

=== Building U-Boot

Building the U-Boot boot loader currently requires a different
tool-chain and therefore a different basic configuration:

[source,console]
MACHINE=tx6q-1030 source ./setup-environment build-tx6q-1030
bitbake u-boot

The following 'MACHINE' configurations are available to build U-Boot:

[source,console]
tx6q-1030
tx6q-1036
tx6q-1130
tx6q-8037
tx6q-8137
tx6s-8034
tx6s-8035
tx6s-8134
tx6s-8135
tx6u-8030
tx6u-8033
tx6u-8130
tx6u-8133
txul-5010
txul-5011
txul-8013


You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `sources` within your chosen
directory (here 'karo-bsp').

== Contributing
